# GitHub Workflows Metrics

GitHub Workflows Metrics is a GitHub Action to measure duration of GitHub Workflows.
This will display charts for each GitHub Workflow, similar to the one shown below, on a GitHub issue.

    y-axis "Duration (average in seconds)"
    bar [38, 39, 37, 42,41, 43, 37, 46, 38,41, 43, 38, 39, 54,41, 42, 69]
```

## Motivation

When running CI with GitHub Actions, it's difficult to see the trend of GitHub workflow execution times.
Wouldn't it be easier to measure the results of efforts to shorten CI execution times
if this trend could be understood at a glance through a chart?
This Action was created with that motivation in mind.

## Usage

You should define a workflow like this:

```yaml
name: GitHub Workflows Metrics
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "30 10 * * *"
permissions:
  actions: read
  issues: write
jobs:
  metrics:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: yykamei/github-workflows-metrics@main
        with:
          only: ci.yml
          status: success
```
